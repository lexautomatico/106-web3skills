  "contact_subtitle3": "A Web3 address is like your digital identity on the decentralized web, commonly associated with blockchain technology. It's similar to an email address but used for interacting with decentralized applications (dApps), sending/receiving digital artifacts, and accessing various decentralized services.",
  "contact_subtitle4": "To create a Web3 address, you typically generate a cryptographic key pair consisting of a public key and a private key. The public key is your address, visible to everyone, while the private key is kept secret and is used to sign transactions. This process ensures security and authenticity in transactions on the blockchain.",
  "contact_subtitle5": "Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is a method used to generate these key pairs. Imagine a curve plotted on a graph where mathematical operations (like addition and multiplication) are defined. ECC exploits the properties of these curves to provide security. In simple terms, it's like drawing a secret line on a curve that only you know, and others can verify using your public key.",
